Recipes from my projects with GPL license

Used with AWS platform(EC2, VPC,S3, Cloudformation, IAM...)

Vagrant creates the ec2 instances and assigns chef roles and environment

The easiest example for begin to work with Chef is creating a mediawiki site with cookbook wiki_app

which has detailed instructions and is a common stack in PHP world.
